# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Notebooks - AI Training with Dr. Mohamed El Zorkany

This series is part of a comprehensive journey that transitions from foundational ML concepts to advanced topics.

## ðŸ“š About the Training

This program focuses on practical, hands-on learning using **Google Colab**.  
What makes this experience unique is Dr. Zorkanyâ€™s **professional way of illustrating concepts**, blending academic knowledge with **real-world experience** in the AI field.

## âœ… Topics Covered

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Decision Trees  
- Evaluation Metrics  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Real-world ML Applications
- Bonus: Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing steps


> All notebooks are created and executed in **Google Colab** for easy access and reproducibility.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Click on any notebook to explore it.
2. Run it in Google Colab using the "Open in Colab" button or upload to your own Google Drive.
3. Feel free to fork this repo or use the code as a reference in your own learning journey.

## ðŸ“Œ Upcoming

This repository is the first part of a larger AI learning track. The next step will be:
- **Deep Learning Notebooks** (Coming soon...)
